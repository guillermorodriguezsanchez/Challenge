# Challenge

During this project, we utilized NodeJS and MongoDB for the Backend and ReactJS for the Frontend development of our application. Our main objective was to create a flexible architecture that enables the REST API to access data locally when the ERP database is unavailable. The challenge was to design a solution that is reusable for other services, and the middleware should be agnostic of the data structure being exchanged. Our aim was not to make the application work offline, but rather to find a way to update the data for offline use through manual user requests or automatic background tasks within the app.
